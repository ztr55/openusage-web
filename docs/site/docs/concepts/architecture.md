description: How OpenUsage discovers tools, polls providers via the daemon, and renders snapshots in the TUI.
---

OpenUsage is a single Go binary with a background daemon that collects data, persists it to SQLite, and serves a unified read model to thin local clients. The terminal UI and optional browser UI never talk to provider APIs directly — they always read from the daemon.

## Mental model

At the highest level there are five moving parts:

1. **Detector** — scans your machine for installed AI tools and known API key environment variables.
2. **Providers** — one per AI service, each knows how to fetch a snapshot of usage for an account.
3. **Daemon** — long-running service that drives the polling loop, accepts hook events from agent integrations, and persists everything to SQLite.
4. **Snapshots** — a normalized data structure (`UsageSnapshot`) that captures spend, tokens, models, rate limits, and status for one account at one point in time. The daemon's `ReadModel` rebuilds these from stored events on each TUI request.
5. **Clients** — the Bubble Tea app and optional browser app connect to the daemon over a Unix domain socket and render snapshots into tiles, gauges, charts, and detail views.

```

Three input sources feed the pipeline:

- **Collectors** — driven by the daemon's polling loop. They call each provider's `Fetch()` on the configured interval and emit snapshots and derived events.
- **Hooks** — agent integrations (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) POST per-turn events to the daemon over its Unix socket as they happen.
- **Spool** — when the daemon is briefly unreachable, hook clients drop events into a disk queue (`~/.local/state/openusage/telemetry-spool/`) that is drained on next startup.

Trade-offs:

- Data survives across TUI sessions and machine reboots, capped by `data.retention_days` (default 30).
- Per-turn detail from agents is far richer than polling alone could see.
- One always-on process and a SQLite file (`~/.local/state/openusage/telemetry.db`).

For more on event flow and dedup, see [telemetry](telemetry.md).

## Core types

Every provider implements the same interface:

```go
type UsageProvider interface {
    ID() string
    Describe() ProviderInfo
    Spec() ProviderSpec
    DashboardWidget() DashboardWidget
    DetailWidget() DetailWidget
    Fetch(ctx context.Context, acct AccountConfig) (UsageSnapshot, error)
}
```

- `Spec()` declares auth/setup metadata and widget layouts.
- `Fetch()` is the only side-effecting call: it talks to an API, reads files, or shells out to a CLI. The daemon drives it; the TUI never calls it.
- `UsageSnapshot` is the only thing the TUI knows about — all rendering is driven from it plus the static widget definitions.

## How the pieces meet

| Layer | Responsibility | Code |
|---|---|---|
| Config | Load `settings.json`, merge with detection | `internal/config/` |
| Detection | Find installed tools and env-var-backed keys | `internal/detect/` |
| Providers | Implement `UsageProvider` per service | `internal/providers/<name>/` |
| Daemon | Run pipeline, expose UDS endpoints | `internal/daemon/` |
| Telemetry | Store/query events, build read models | `internal/telemetry/` |
| TUI | Render snapshots, handle keys | `internal/tui/` |
| Web | Serve redacted API and browser UI | `internal/web/`, `website/src/dashboard/` |

## Key invariants

- The TUI never talks to an AI provider directly — only to the daemon over its Unix socket.
- The browser never talks to an AI provider, SQLite, or the daemon socket directly — it uses the loopback web API.
- API keys are referenced by env-var name in config (`api_key_env`), never stored.
- `AccountConfig.Token` has `json:"-"` so runtime tokens never persist.
- The daemon and terminal UI communicate over a Unix domain socket. The optional web process adds a separate loopback-only HTTP boundary.
